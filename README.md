# get_next_line

## Description
get_next_line is a project from the 42 common core curriculum. The goal is to create a `get_next_line()` function that takes a file descriptor as a parameter and returns the next line of the file on every call.

## Makefile
I added a Makefile to the project with the following commands:
- `make` or `make all` : Compile source files and create the library
- `make clean` : Remove all object files (.o)
- `make fclean` : Execute clean + remove the library
- `make re` : Execute fclean + all (full recompilation)
- `make bonus` : Compile bonus functions (if applicable)
